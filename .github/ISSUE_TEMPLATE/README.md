## How to Use

1. Go to the repository's [Issues page](https://github.com/msc2402/skills-expand-your-team-with-copilot/issues)
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select the appropriate template for your request
4. Fill out all required fields marked with *
5. Provide as much detail as possible to help the development team understand your needs

## Why These Templates Help

Each template includes:
- **Clear problem description fields** - so the development team understands what you need
- **Acceptance criteria** - defining when the request is complete
- **Implementation hints** - helping developers know where to make changes
- **Context and limitations** - providing background information

This ensures that when a Copilot coding agent is assigned to implement your request, they have all the information needed to complete the work without additional clarification.
