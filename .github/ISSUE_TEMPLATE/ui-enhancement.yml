        ### Acceptance Criteria
        
        For the development team, this request will be considered complete when:
        - The specified UI improvement is implemented and visible to users
        - The enhancement works consistently across specified device types
        - The change improves usability without breaking existing functionality
        - The implementation follows existing design patterns in the application
        - Any new interface elements are accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
        
        ### Implementation Areas
        
        Depending on the enhancement type, changes may be needed in:
        - **Frontend styling**: `src/static/styles.css`
        - **HTML structure**: `src/static/index.html`
        - **JavaScript interactions**: `src/static/app.js`
        - **Backend API**: `src/backend/routers/` (if new data or functionality needed)
        
        ### Design Considerations
        
        - Maintain consistency with existing visual style
        - Ensure mobile responsiveness if not already specified
        - Consider accessibility guidelines (color contrast, keyboard navigation)
        - Test with different screen sizes and browsers
        - Preserve existing functionality while adding improvements
